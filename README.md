## QuickBMP 

This is a small project that writes BMP format images in 4 forms
* 32 bit
* 24 bit
* 16 bit
* 8 bit (256 color palette)

If this is useful to someone, great!

I needed something to dump some information in a visual way and this is probably one of the simplest ways to do it. 

### Note

This is not really cross platform and expects little-endian compiler/CPU
